# gtrendsR 1.5.2

- Various internal changes to better deal with missing data returned by queries (#418, #419).

# gtrendsR 1.5.1

- Fix missing `userType` in the payload which was giving a 401 error (#413). Thanks to @philipwlewis for reporting and fix proposition.

# gtrendsR 1.5.0

## Bug fixes

- `read.csv()` now uses `encoding = "UTF-8"` to better deal with non-ascii characters (#394).

- Setting locale in queries via the `hl`argument now returns data (@marcf-91). For example, `gtrends(keyword = "Macron", geo = "FR", hl = "fr")`.

- It was difficult to maintain an up-to-date database of all country codes supported by Google because they do not provide such a list. `gtrends()` now only checks the syntax structure of the entered code to make sure it matches the iso format (#390).

## New feature

- `gtrends()` as a new parameter `compared_breakdown`. When set to `TRUE`, then the relative hits across the keywords will be returned. Can only be used if one `geo` is used conjointly with more than one keyword. For example: `head(gtrends(keyword = c("nhl", "nba"), geo = "CA", compared_breakdown = TRUE)$interest_by_region)` (#404).

# gtrendsR 1.4.8

- Fixing breaking changes that were introduced by Google Trends (#252) @kevinmager65.

- Can now search without keywords (`gtrends(geo = c("CA"), category = 20)`).

# gtrendsR 1.4.0

- Support for hourly and daily data (#67). For example, it is now possible to have hourly data for the last seven days with `gtrends("nhl", geo = "CA", res = "7d")`. Use `?gtrends` for more information about the time resolution supported by the package.

- Support for categories (#46). Ex.: `gtrends("NHL", geo = "US", cat = "0-20")` will search only in the _sport_ category.

- Some countries (ex: Hong Kong) were missing from the list (#69).

- Various typos and documentation work.

# gtrendsR 1.3.2
